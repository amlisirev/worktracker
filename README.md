# worktracker
learning project for Swift to track working hours and print the annoying paper reports required by my office.

Built and used extensively on an iPhone SE. layout issues might persist on other screen sizes, although I tried adhering to general autolayout rules.

still missing: 
  -deleting created report pdf's
  -listing pdf's
  -resending them
  -deletion confirmations for mission critical info

Project probably dropped, has served it's purpose at my previous job, and Toggl exists.
